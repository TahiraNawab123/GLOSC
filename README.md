## 📊 Data Structures Overview

| Module | Primary Data Structures |
|--------|------------------------|
| Warehouse | BST (Product Catalog), Queue (Inventory), Graph (Storage Bins) |
| Orders | Max-Heap (Priority), BST (Order Search), Stack (Loading) |
| Fleet | BST (Vehicle Search), Linked List (Vehicle List), Graph (Routes) |
| Shipment | BST (Shipment Tree), Graph (Route Network), Dynamic Array |

## 🎨 UI Design

The application features a professional, light-themed user interface with:
- Clean color palette (soft blues, grays, and accent colors)
- Well-structured visual hierarchy
- Consistent spacing and alignment
- Intuitive menu navigation
- Clear status messages and feedback

## 📝 File I/O

The system uses text files for data persistence:
- `Files/products.txt` - Product records
- `Files/orders.txt` - Order history
- `Files/categories.txt` - Category definitions
- `Files/queue_log.txt` - Inventory queue operations

## 🔒 Notes

- All operations flow through the Warehouse Central Hub
- The system maintains data integrity through proper memory management
- Template-based implementations ensure type safety
- Forward declarations prevent circular dependencies
